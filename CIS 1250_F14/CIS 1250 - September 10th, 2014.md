##Design in General and in Software
 Going to look at a couple of designs.
 System Design is not Artisitic Design
 Design = plan, implementation, interaction
  > drawing out the plans
  > implementing reveals design problems
  
  Routine designs do exist for software
  Original designs tend to be for new things
  
  Waterfall model:
  > 1. System Req
  > 2. Soft Req
  > 3. Analysis
  > 4. Program Desing
  > 5. Coding
  > 6. Testing
  > 7. Operations

What worked:
> Had clear steps (easier for planning )
> Let people communicate and provide info for the dev

What didnt work
> Knowing what needs to be done
> Assumes you know what the problem is but thats not the case a lot of times
> Designers dont think that way, most design is done in small bits

Design by Comimittee
> Impractical
> Turns into a "wishlist"
> unrealistic
> 

Requirements bloat and creep
> unecessary requirements
> bloat happens at the start and creep happens during dev

Collboration

Since 1900, 2 big changes on building something
> 1. Teams
> 2. Some form telecommunications (can have misunderstandings)
> 

Whychange from solo to multi?
>Requires specialists
>make the product faster
>will have some probelms initially, will have other companies competing against you
> 

Cost of collaboration
> Dividing up tasks fairly 
> Integration (putting pieces back togeether)
> Communication with people in youur team (bigger teams means harder communication)
