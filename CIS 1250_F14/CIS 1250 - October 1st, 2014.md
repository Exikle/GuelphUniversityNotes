- lead to difrent results
- creating something new/innovative is difficult
- process comes into play often with a mature product
- process addresses the past problems
- process is veto orientated
	- if idea looks to difficult, or way out of there but is good, cna still get vetoed
		- sometimes needs a manager with "vision"

- process is driven by consensus
	- use experience to decide what is bad or good

- Do weed need process at all?
	- schedule, manufacturing, 

- Updated products
	- once user starts using product, they dont want too much changed

- Pareto Principl (80/20 Rule)
	- 80% is easy part, will take 20% of the the time, vice versa
	- 20% input (time, res, effort), 80% output (results, rewards)
